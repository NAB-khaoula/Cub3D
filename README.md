## General info
CUB3D is a 42-networking project, inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever. The aim of this project is to create a dynamic view inside a maze, in which the player will have to find his way.
CUB3D is a great opportunity to explore ray-casting technology, and to improve the skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
